# Projection management

The various gRPC client APIs include dedicated clients that allow you to manage projections.

For a detailed explanation of projections, see the [server documentation](@server/features/projections/README.md).

You can find the full sample code from this documentation page in the respective [clients repositories](https://github.com/kurrent-io/?q=client).

## Required packages

Install the client SDK package to your project.

### NodeJS

Add `@kurrent/kurrentdb-client` to your project using Yarn, NPM, or pnpm.

TypeScript type declarations are included in the package.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install --save @kurrent/kurrentdb-client
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @kurrent/kurrentdb-client
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @kurrent/kurrentdb-client
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating a client

Projection management operations are exposed through a dedicated client.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_createClient_projection_management} />

## Create a projection

Creates a projection that runs until the last event in the store, and then continues processing new events as they are appended to the store. The query parameter contains the JavaScript you want created as a projection.
Projections have explicit names, and you can enable or disable them via this name.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_CreateContinuous_projection_management} />

Trying to create projections with the same name will result in an error:

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_CreateContinuous_Conflict_projection_management} />

## Restart the subsystem

It is possible to restart the entire projection subsystem using the projections management client API. The user must be in the `$ops` or `$admin` group to perform this operation.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_RestartSubSystem_projection_management} />

## Enable a projection

Enables an existing projection by name.
Once enabled, the projection will start to process events even after restarting the server or the projection subsystem.
You must have access to a projection to enable it, see the [ACL documentation](@server/security/user-authorization.md).

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_Enable_projection_management} />

You can only enable an existing projection. When you try to enable a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_EnableNotFound_projection_management} />

## Disable a projection

Disables a projection, this will save the projection checkpoint.
Once disabled, the projection will not process events even after restarting the server or the projection subsystem.
You must have access to a projection to disable it, see the [ACL documentation](@server/security/user-authorization.md).

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_Disable_projection_management} />

You can only disable an existing projection. When you try to disable a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_DisableNotFound_projection_management} />

## Delete a projection

Deletes an existing projection. You must disable the projection before deleting it, running projections cannot be deleted. Deleting a projection includes deleting the checkpoint and the emitted streams.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_Delete_projection_management} />

You can only delete an existing projection. When you try to delete a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_DeleteNotFound_projection_management} />

## Abort a projection

Aborts a projection, this will not save the projection's checkpoint.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_Abort_projection_management} />

You can only abort an existing projection. When you try to abort a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_Abort_NotFound_projection_management} />

## Reset a projection

Resets a projection, which causes deleting the projection checkpoint. This will force the projection to start afresh and re-emit events. Streams that are written to from the projection will also be soft-deleted.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_Reset_projection_management} />

Resetting a projection that does not exist will result in an error.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_Reset_NotFound_projection_management} />

## Update a projection

Updates a projection with a given name. The query parameter contains the new JavaScript. Updating system projections using this operation is not supported at the moment.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_Update_projection_management} />

You can only update an existing projection. When you try to update a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_Update_NotFound_projection_management} />

## List all projections

Returns a list of all projections, user defined & system projections.
See the [projection details](#projection-details) section for an explanation of the returned values.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_ListAll_projection_management} />

## List continuous projections

Returns a list of all continuous projections.
See the [projection details](#projection-details) section for an explanation of the returned values.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_ListContinuous_projection_management} />

## Get status

Gets the status of a named projection.
See the [projection details](#projection-details) section for an explanation of the returned values.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_GetStatus_projection_management} />

## Get state

Retrieves the state of a projection.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_GetState_projection_management} />

## Get result

Retrieves the result of the named projection and partition.

<Code lang="typescript" code={typescript_GetResult_projection_management} />

## Projection Details

[List all](#list-all-projections), [list continuous](#list-continuous-projections) and [get status](#get-status) all return the details and statistics of projections
